                       <p style="font-size: 20px"class="para">To be is an act of creation. Inherently, by existing, one lives in a state of creation. And not only a state of creation’s completion but rather creation’s perpetuation. Just through living, one creates ideas, steps, prints. Just through being, we elucidate that creation is the natural state of the human experience. 
<br><br>We colloquially view creation as painting or music or sculpture, or potentially even family building or company building. These are indeed forms of creation but only deliberately intensified forms. Without a consciousness for this deliberate need to create, people create constantly without having the slightest recognition. The creative act is, as Rick titles his book, a way of being. I would argue that even Rick here, though, neglects that the creative act is not a way of being but rather <i>the</i> way of being. We have begun to place too much emphasis on creation in its most heightened, focused forms. We have surrounded ourselves with too many objects, plans, tasks, and obligations that obfuscate our ability to touch the inner source of our own creative power, to truly come to peace with the fact that creation is the natural way of being and to see the beauty in daily creation: a smile, a laugh, and much more. 
<br><br>When we trim the excess of life—often the creation of others that we accept without question—we can begin to create ourselves. We can begin to tap into what Rick describes as the Source, the inner flow of inspiration and ideas that exists within all. I am particularly drawn to the idea that no new knowledge or wisdom is ever gained from without but rather uncovered from within. It is Michelangelo freeing the sculpture from the marble, as opposed to creating from a block, from the ether. Through centering oneself in the greatest amount of pure focus possible, one can begin to uncover an understanding that can beget a more full life of creation. It is through simplicity that we come to understanding. It is through understanding that we come to wisdom. It is through wisdom that we come to know that all we must do is create.
